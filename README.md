# RetroFusion: Dynamic Gameplay Control with Mobile Sensors

RetroFusion is an open-source project that turns your smartphone into a motion-based game controller. With just your phone and a local connection, you can experience immersive and responsive gameplay. This project demonstrates the potential of leveraging smartphone sensors to create engaging and intuitive gaming experiences.

## üé• Game Demo

## ‚ú® Features
- **Motion-Based Gameplay**: Use your smartphone's sensors for in-game actions.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Low-latency communication ensures smooth gameplay.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Compatible with Android, iOS, and desktop platforms.
- **Cricket Game Demo**: Includes a demo game with realistic physics and scoring.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
1. **Phone as Controller**: Leverages your phone's accelerometer, gyroscope, and orientation sensors for input.
2. **Local Connection**: Connects to the game host using efficient network protocols.
3. **Game Integration**: Combines sensor inputs with game mechanics for seamless interaction.

## ‚ö° Setup
1. **Download the Apps**:
   - Mobile: [SensorStream.apk](https://dist.bishal0602.com.np/retrofusion/SensorStream.apk)
   - PC: [retrofusion.exe](http://dist.bishal0602.com.np/retrofusion/retrofusion.exe)
   
2. **Connect Devices**: Make sure both your **PC** and **mobile** are on the **same local network**.

3. **Start the Game**:
   - Open `retrofusion.exe` on your PC.
   - Open the `SensorStream.apk` on your mobile and select the displayed server.
   - Click "Search for Host" on the mobile app and click on the discovered host.
   - Click "Start" on the mobile app to stream sensor data and enjoy the gameplay!

## üåü Highlights
- **Smooth Gameplay**: Uses quaternion-based motion handling for precise controls.
- **Realistic Physics**: Physics-driven interactions for a natural feel.
- **Simple Setup**: Intuitive host discovery and quick connection.

## üöÄ Future Plans
- Expand to additional game genres.
- Improve performance on older devices.
- Explore advanced motion mapping techniques.
